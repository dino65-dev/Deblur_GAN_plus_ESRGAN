# MIRNet Low-Light Enhancement + ESRGAN Super-Resolution

This repository combines the power of **MIRNet** (Multi-Scale Residual Network) for low-light image enhancement and **ESRGAN** (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN) for high-resolution image reconstruction. The pipeline first improves low-light images using MIRNet and then applies ESRGAN to upscale the resolution, making it ideal for enhancing and super-resolving dark and blurry images.


## Features
- **Low-Light Enhancement**: Uses MIRNet to improve the visibility of images taken in poor lighting conditions.
- **Super-Resolution**: Utilizes ESRGAN to upscale the image, enhancing fine details and textures.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Input an image and get a fully enhanced high-resolution output in a few steps.


### Key Highlights:
- **Features** section describes what the combined model does.
- **Usage** Just run the code and do one thing adjust the path of input output.
- **Contributing** invites users to participate in the project.
- **License** details the licensing information.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust any part!
